						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about the concept of dark patterns in user experience design, which are manipulative tactics used to deceive and coerce users into making choices they may not have made otherwise. The article argues that designers have a responsibility to avoid using dark patterns in their work and instead prioritize ethical design practices that prioritize user autonomy and well-being. Using these dark patterns are unjust and should not be used to manipulate users. </p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was the author's discussion of the ethical responsibility of designers to prioritize the user over the business. This reminded me of the importance of considering the impact of my work on others and the world around me, rather than simply pursuing personal gain. It made me come to the realization that many people could be falling for these Dark Patterns and if I eventually want a career in UX/UI Design that I would have to be weary of this. </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>  "Designers have an ethical responsibility to prioritize the user over the business, and to use their skills to create positive experiences that empower users rather than deceive them."  </p>
