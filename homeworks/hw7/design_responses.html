							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about the Gestalt Principles in UI Design, which are a set of principles used to design interfaces that are visually and cognitively appealing to users. I learned that these principles help designers create an organized and harmonious layout by using techniques such as proximity, similarity, and continuation. I also learned that by understanding and applying these principles, designers can create interfaces that are easier to use and navigate, and that can ultimately improve the user experience. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the section on the principle of continuity. I found it interesting how the human brain naturally seeks out patterns and will try to complete an incomplete shape or pattern based on prior experience. This principle can be applied in UI design to create a sense of flow and continuity in the layout, which can make the interface more intuitive and easier to use. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "By taking into consideration these Gestalt principles, designers can craft interfaces that are intuitive and delightful to use, but most importantly, interfaces that work seamlessly without much explanation." </p>
						</li>
