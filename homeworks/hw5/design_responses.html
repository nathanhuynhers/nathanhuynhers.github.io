                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is that many applications and interfaces use transitions to catch the audiences eyes. Most of them are smooth transitions and out in the open so the audience can focus on it. I also learned that these interfaces uses the F layout that we talked about in class. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is that there was no reading. It showed many examples of gifs and transitions which I have no experience in so I'm glad I could just focus solely on these items. With no reading, it gives me more time to actually look and analyze these items. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration is the Travel Map by Never-stop for Radio Design. This one is my favorite because it shows how a human would interact with this website. They would type their destination in mind and it would show transitions narrowing down the choices. It also showed transitions to when you clicked on a location. The interface achieves its unique/delightful manner by using these transitions to make it pleasing for the human using the app. These transitions and animations also make it easier for the human to narrow down on where they want to go. They successfully created many human design interactions. </p>
