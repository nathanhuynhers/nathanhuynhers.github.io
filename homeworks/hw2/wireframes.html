					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/WF1.jpg" />
							<p> zoro.to/home </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/WF2.jpg" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> <strong> The goal of the website is to display a selection of animes to watch from. It's intended for people trying to watch anime. The design accomplishes showing a bunch of trending anime to the viewer.</strong> </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> <strong> My redesign addressed multiple things. It made more space for the search bar and removed icons I believed were unnecessary and making the top look crunched up. I then thought it was unnecessary how they had one huge show covering the whole screen and then a bunch of tiny images of other trending shows right below it. They used the whole website for one function so I redesigned it to have a continue watching section and the trending show section. For the bottom part (trending shows part) I only put three images instead of the eight to open up more negative space, while preventing it from looking clustered. To still please the audience by showing them a bunch of shows instead of just three, I put two side bars to choose to move the selection left or right to view more. If I could, I would implement an animation that would automatically scroll between the shows, to simultaneuously show multiple.</strong> </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
