					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that Color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impaired counterparts. There are also legal implications and lawsuits for making websites non color accessible. Adding contrast, relying less on color, and documenting and socializing color system are ways to ensure your product is color accessible. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was learning what color accessible even meant. Since I'm completely new to web design and design in general, I wasn't thinking about the colorblind people and more. This makes me realize that I need to be more careful and considerate when using colors in my websites and future products. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
