						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article was that text is one of the ways a designer can communicate with users. The style and aesthetic of the text sets a certain setting and mood in the designs. This affects the reader's interpretation of the design, whether good or bad. What font you use can be entirely dependent of the audience. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is seeing the many examples of how font affects the audience. I believed all the examples they showed us were visually pleasing and it helped me understand that font gives characteristic and personality to the design. With this new information, I can hopefully apply the beauty of typography into my designs. </p>
