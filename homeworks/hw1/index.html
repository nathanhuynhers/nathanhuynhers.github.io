        <p>Hi my name is Nathan. One of my favorite foods are eggs which is because you can cook an egg in more than 50 ways. In my freetime, I like to play video games such as Valorant. I'm very excited to learn about more about Web Development. My credit card number is. Thanks for having me!</p>

            <li>I learned that apps I use everyday have been developed and designed in a way to appeal to us humans and our eyes. If I want to get better at designing apps and websites for the future, I should start studying all the apps and websites I go on. Most apps have recommendations that they want their audience to click, instead of just being empty.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was definitely the GIFs. Having a GIF slowly break down parts of the design helped me understand which parts stood out and the purpose behind them.</li>
            <li>"Hierarchy How does the design guide your focus? What information is highlighted? How does color and text treatment signal the importance of certain elements?"</li>
