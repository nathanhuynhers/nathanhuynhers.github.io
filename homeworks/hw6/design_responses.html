							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found the section on using motion to guide users particularly interesting. The author's explanation of how motion can be used to establish visual hierarchy and direct users' attention was really helpful.

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Any animation shorter than 100 ms is instantaneous and wonâ€™t be recognized at all. Whereas the animation longer than 1 second would convey a sense of delay and thus be boring for the user."</p>
